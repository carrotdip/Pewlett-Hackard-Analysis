# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to prepare for a wave of retiring employees at Pewlett-Hackard. The analysis was performed by first determining which current employees are eligible for retirement based on birth date. The titles of these employees were also ascertained. A new program was planned to be implemented that will allow retiring employees to work part-time and mentor the new employees, so a list of qualified employees for this program was determined. 
## Results
* There are approximately 330,000 current employees of which 90,000 are eligible for retirement.
* There are approximately 1,500 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. 
* There are approximately 29,000 Senior Engineers/Senior Staff employees retiring and 13,000 Engineers/Senior Staff retiring. 
* 
## Summary
There are approximately 90,000 roles that need to be filled following the "silver tsunami". Of those, approximately 29,000 will need to be Senior Engineers/Senior Staff roles, and 13,000 will need to be Engineers and Staff. There are approximately 1,500 employees who are eligible to mentor and train the new recruits. If implemented, that would be 60 mentees per mentor, which is a substantial amount. I would conclude that there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in each department to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees. 
I would recommend an additional query to look for qualified, non-retiring employees who will be able to play a role in the mentorship program. 
I would recommend an additional query to determine the count of current employees by title. This will provide additional insight on the distribution of employees as Pewlett-Hackard as well as which roles need to be filled when compared to the retiring_titles table. This will aid in determining which roles have the highest or lowest demand.
